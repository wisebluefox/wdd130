        <p> Hello! My name is Marisol Moya! I am from Arizona, but I am currently living
            in Durham, North Carolina. I work as a researcher for Duke University. We are a
            protein production research facility. My favorite things to do are read Manhwa and Books,
            and travel. I also enjoy learning languages and am currently learning Japanese and Russian.
            I am studying software development because I would like to work on the development of
            game software and perhaps be a nomadic worker. I also really like to learn how to play traditional
            instruments
            like the Erhu, Chinese Flute, Glockenspiel, and Lyre Harp. I am excited to be part of this class and learn
            more in the future!
        </p>

        <h2>Arizona</h2>
        <img src="images/arizona.jpg" alt="Arizona Cactus">
        <p>Arizona is a dessert state. The land of cactuses, red and pink sunsets, and flash floods. This image was
            taken after a freak storm that hit the area.
            The ground had a fresh wet mineral scent, the plants gained a greener hue under the red setting sun,
            after a 10 minutes flash flooding storm.
            Arizona is not for the weak in heart. If you cannot stand extreme heat temperatures 75% of the year and
            then extreme cold temperatures the other 25%,
            then do not move to Arizona. One of the greatest benefits of Arizona is its location. Being next to the
            Mexico border makes it easy to transverse across
            borders and experience authentic Mexican culture and food. A wonderful place ful of snowbirds.
